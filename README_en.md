**AutoTame** is a **Minecraft client-side mod** that simplifies the process of **taming horse-like animals**.  

In vanilla Minecraft, if a player fails to tame **horse-like animals (such as horses, donkeys, and llamas)**, they need to try again manually. This mod **automatically retries until the animal is successfully tamed**.
